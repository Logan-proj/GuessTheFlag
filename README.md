Based on the structure of your previous GitHub project README for "WeSplit-App," here's how you can structure the README for your "GuessTheFlag" project:

# GuessTheFlag

"GuessTheFlag" is a SwiftUI-based game that challenges players to identify flags from various countries. 

## Credits and Acknowledgements

"GuessTheFlag" was developed as part of my journey through learning SwiftUI, with inspiration from various online resources and tutorials. It represents one of the many projects in my endeavor to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI and its application in iOS development.

A special thanks to the online programming community and the numerous sample projects and documentation available for SwiftUI which have been instrumental in the creation of this game.

## Features

- **Random Flag Selection**: Randomly shuffles the flags to present a new challenge every time.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the user's score throughout the session.
- **Game Over Logic**: Ends the game after a certain number of rounds and presents the final score.
- **Restart Game**: Allows players to restart the game after it ends.
- **Dynamic Alerts**: Shows alerts to give feedback on the user's selectionâ€”correct or incorrect.

## What I Learned

The development of "GuessTheFlag" has been an educational experience where I have:

- **Deepened my SwiftUI knowledge**: Gained a better understanding of the SwiftUI framework and its components.
- **State Management**: Learned to manage app state using `@State` properties and how they interact with the app's view.
- **UI Flow and Alerts**: Implemented alerts and modals to provide feedback and guide the user through the game's flow.
- **Game Logic**: Developed the logic to handle the selection of flags, randomize choices, and determine game over conditions.
- **User Interface**: Designed a user interface that's both aesthetic and functional, utilizing gradients, shadows, and other SwiftUI views.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS running the latest stable version of Xcode.
- Basic understanding of SwiftUI.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Logan-proj/GuessTheFlag.git
```
2. Open `GuessTheFlag.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on your preferred simulator or physical device.

## Usage

Upon launching the app:

1. You'll be presented with three flags.
2. Tap the flag that matches the country name displayed.
3. An alert will confirm whether you guessed correctly and will update your score.
4. After eight rounds, the game will show your final score and give you the option to restart.
