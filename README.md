## Credits and Acknowledgements

"GuessTheFlag" was developed as a code-along project following the tutorials provided by [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). It's a part of their "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge, which offers comprehensive, hands-on lessons on SwiftUI.

This project provided an excellent opportunity to explore the intricacies of SwiftUI, guided by the resources and tutorials provided by Hacking with Swift. The step-by-step approach ensured that every concept and its implementation were thoroughly understood.

Thanks again to [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) for providing this educational content for beginners.

## Features

- **Random Flag Selection**: Randomly shuffles the flags to present a new challenge every time.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the user's score throughout the session.
- **Game Over Logic**: Ends the game after a certain number of rounds and presents the final score.
- **Restart Game**: Allows players to restart the game after it ends.
- **Dynamic Alerts**: Shows alerts to give feedback on the user's selectionâ€”correct or incorrect.

## What I Learned

The development of "GuessTheFlag" has been an educational experience where I have:

- **Deepened my SwiftUI knowledge**: Gained a better understanding of the SwiftUI framework and its components.
- **State Management**: Learned to manage app state using `@State` properties and how they interact with the app's view.
- **UI Flow and Alerts**: Implemented alerts and modals to provide feedback and guide the user through the game's flow.
- **Game Logic**: Developed the logic to handle the selection of flags, randomize choices, and determine game over conditions.
- **User Interface**: Designed a user interface that's both aesthetic and functional, utilizing gradients, shadows, and other SwiftUI views.
